Storming through the party like my name was
El Nino
When I’m hangin out drinking in the back of
an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by
name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody
cameWell, I know I’m not the one you thought you
knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had
to
Is it attention that we crave, don’t tell us to
behave
I’m sick of always hearing act your ageI don’t want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I’ll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back downBecause you don’t
Know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience
so small
Heavy metal and mullets, it’s how we were
raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we
praised'Cause we like having fun at other peoples
expense and
Cutting people down is just a minor offense
and
It’s none of your concern, I guess I’ll never
learn
I’m sick of being told to wait my turnI don’t want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society

I’ll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back downDon’t count on me, to let you know when
Don’t count on me, I’ll do it again
Don’t count on me, it’s the point you’re
missing
Don’t count on me, 'cause I’m not listeningWell I’m a no-goody lower middle class brat
Back packed and I don’t give a sh** about
nothing
You be standing on the corner talking all that
kufuffin'
But you don’t make sense from all the gas
you be huffin'
'Cause if the egg don’t stain, you’ll be
ringing off the hook
You’re on the hit list, wanted in the telephone
book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in
proportion
The doctor said my mom should have had an
abortionI don’t want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I’ll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down
Waste my time with them
Casualty of society
Waste my time again
Victim of your conformity
And back down
