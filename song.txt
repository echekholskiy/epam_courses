Storming through the party like my name was
El Nino
When I’m hangin out drinking in the back of
an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by
name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody
cameWell, I know I’m not the one you thought you
knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had
to
Is it attention that we crave, don’t tell us to
behave
